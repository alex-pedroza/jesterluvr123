                    <p>This book had potential, I think, in its compelling explorations of the
                      dimensions of pleasure. Taste, desire, satisfaction - it's hard to distinguish
                      where food ends and the erotic begins (describing a bite of something
                      as "orgasmic" doesn't seem so scandalous as I once thought). I was intrigued
                      by the ability to weaponize food, dining experiences, and specific sociocultural norms
                      in a game of clever chess - the Eun-Young persona exists entirely in a submissive
                      racialized and sexualized imagination alongside promises of a safe future in which
                      pleasure is not discontinued. That much was clear and fascinating, and I enjoyed
                      the explorations of the narrator's relationship to apetite as checkpoints
                      throughout the story.

                      But the embellishment fog was frustrating to wade through
                      - the writing works better as small bits of digestible prose rather
                      than a full length novel. Not every sentence had to be cloaked in metaphor.
                      And Aida was a weird character -- I could not really see her motives past
                      her age, even in this post-apocalyptic setting. She was childish in her
                      decision-making, temperamental and unsurprisingly disliked by all the
                      people she worked with. I'm not sure that the reader is supposed to like Aida, even
                      at the end with her sad attempt at atoning for running over that child in
                      her sports car or whatever. She was a more distinguished version of her robot
                      father, always doing impact calculus through her fronts, and cunning in a way
                      that made our narrator attracted to her. I'm not sure there was any more depth than
                      that, of either her or the narrator. And that ending... phew, did not add anything of substance
                      to the story.
